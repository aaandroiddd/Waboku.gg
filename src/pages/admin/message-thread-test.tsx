          <p className="mb-4">
            This page tests the behavior of message threads when they are deleted by one user and then the other user sends a new message.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The current implementation in <code>useMessages.ts</code> marks a chat as deleted for a specific user by setting a flag in the <code>deletedBy</code> field, but it does not automatically recreate the thread when a new message is received.
          </p>
          <p>
            The test below allows you to verify this behavior and implement a fix that will automatically restore deleted threads when new messages are received.
          </p>

        <MessageThreadTest />

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Implementation Details</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The fix for this issue involves modifying the real-time listener in the messages page to check if:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>A chat is marked as deleted for the current user</li>
            <li>A new message has been received from another user</li>
            <li>The new message timestamp is after the deletion timestamp</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If these conditions are met, the chat should be "undeleted" by removing the user's ID from the <code>deletedBy</code> field, making the thread visible again.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach ensures that users don't miss important messages while still allowing them to manage their message threads.
          </p>
        </Card>
      </div>
    </DashboardLayout>
