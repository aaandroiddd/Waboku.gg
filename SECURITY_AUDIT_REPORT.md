# Security Audit Report - Trading Card Marketplace

**Date:** January 2025  
**Application:** Waboku.gg Trading Card Marketplace  
**Audit Type:** Comprehensive Security Review  

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified **multiple critical vulnerabilities** in the trading card marketplace application that could allow new users to exploit the system for financial gain, manipulate reviews, bypass authentication, and access unauthorized data. The vulnerabilities span across authentication, business logic, payment processing, and data access controls.

## 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Bypass
**Severity: CRITICAL**

#### Issues:
- **Review Creation Bypass**: Users could create fake reviews by manipulating the `userId` field in API requests
- **Message Access**: Users could read ALL messages, not just their own conversations
- **Offer Manipulation**: No validation that offer amounts were reasonable compared to listing prices
- **Notification Spam**: Anyone could create notifications for any user

#### Exploitation Scenarios:
- Malicious users creating fake 5-star reviews to boost seller ratings
- Users accessing private conversations between other users
- Spam notifications overwhelming users
- Artificially inflating or deflating seller reputations

### 2. Business Logic Flaws
**Severity: HIGH**

#### Issues:
- **Offer Amount Validation**: No server-side validation of offer amounts against listing prices
- **Self-Transaction Prevention**: Insufficient checks to prevent users from making offers on their own listings
- **Price Manipulation**: Users could potentially manipulate listing prices during updates
- **Payment Verification**: Webhook metadata could be manipulated to bypass payment verification

#### Exploitation Scenarios:
- Users making $1 offers on $1000 listings and potentially getting them accepted
- Users creating fake transactions with themselves
- Payment amounts not matching actual listing prices

### 3. Data Access Control Issues
**Severity: HIGH**

#### Issues:
- **Firestore Rules**: Overly permissive rules allowing unauthorized data access
- **Message Privacy**: Users could access messages they weren't participants in
- **Review Manipulation**: Server-side review creation without proper authentication
- **Notification Access**: Users could potentially access other users' notifications

### 4. Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention
**Severity: MEDIUM**

#### Issues:
- **No Rate Limiting**: Users could spam offers, reviews, and messages
- **Bulk Operations**: No protection against automated abuse
- **Authentication Brute Force**: No protection against repeated login attempts

## 🛡️ Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Firestore Security Rules

**Before:**
```javascript
// Reviews collection - VULNERABLE
match /reviews/{reviewId} {
  allow create: if true; // Anyone could create reviews!
}

// Messages collection - VULNERABLE  
match /messages/{messageId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated(); // Could read ALL messages!
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Reviews collection - SECURED
match /reviews/{reviewId} {
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && 
    request.resource.data.reviewerId == request.auth.uid &&
    isValidReview(request.resource.data);
}

// Messages collection - SECURED
match /messages/{messageId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && 
    (resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid || 
     resource.data.receiverId == request.auth.uid);
}
```

### 2. Server-Side Validation

**Enhanced API Endpoints:**
- `src/pages/api/reviews/create-secure.ts` - Proper authentication and order verification
- `src/pages/api/offers/create-secure.ts` - Listing price validation and self-offer prevention
- `src/lib/payment-verification.ts` - Comprehensive payment validation
- `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts` - Rate limiting for all sensitive operations

### 3. Security Monitoring System

**New Components:**
- `src/lib/security-monitor.ts` - Real-time security event monitoring
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities
- Pattern detection for abuse attempts
- Security event logging and analysis

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Enhanced Validation:**
```javascript
// Offer validation with price checks
function isValidOffer(data) {
  return data.amount > 0 
    && data.amount <= 50000 
    && data.buyerId != data.sellerId
    && data.buyerId == request.auth.uid;
}

// Review validation with rating constraints
function isValidReview(data) {
  return data.rating >= 1 
    && data.rating <= 5 
    && data.rating == math.floor(data.rating)
    && data.reviewerId == request.auth.uid
    && data.reviewerId != data.sellerId;
}
```

## 🔍 Security Monitoring Features
